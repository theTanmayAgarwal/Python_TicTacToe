Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper. The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.

The interesting Python project is built using the pygame library. We have explaining all the pygame object methods that are used in this project. Pygame is a great library that allows us to create the window and draw images and shapes on the window. This way we captured mouse coordinates and identify the block where we need to mark ‘X’ or ‘O’.

## Steps to Build a Python Tic Tac Toe Game
Let’s check the steps to build Tic Tac Toe program in Python:

- Create the display window for our game.
- Draw the grid on the canvas where we will play Tic Tac Toe.
- Draw the status bar below the canvas to show which player’s turn is it and who wins the game.
- When someone wins the game or the game is a draw then we reset the game.

We need to run our game inside an infinite loop. It continuously looks for events and when a user presses the mouse button on the grid we will first get the X and Y coordinates of the mouse. Then we check which square the user has clicked. Then we drew the appropriate ‘X’ or ‘O’ image on the canvas. So that is basically what we have done in this Python project idea.
